     * Find word in multi-line string and print matching lines and line numbers.
     * <p>
     * For example, given the string:
     * <pre>
     * Hello, there!
     * I'm here.
     * You're there.
     * Therefore, we're near.
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * If the search term is "there" or "There" or "THERE", the following lines
     * should be printed:
     * <pre>
     * 1: Hello, there!
     * 3: You're there.
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * If the search term is "I'm" or "i'm", the following lines should be printed
     * <pre>
     * "2: I'm here."
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Here are some things to keep in mind:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Note that the line numbering is 1-indexed: i.e., the first line is line 1, not line 0,
     * which might be a bit more natural to a computer scientist.</li>
     * <li>Matches are always case-insensitive.</li>
     * <li>The follow characters are considered word boundaries and will never be part of the search
     * term: ' ', '.', '!', '?', ',', ';', '(', ')', '-'</li>
     * <li>So, for example, searching for "two" should match "two fold", "two.", "two!", "two?",
     * "two,", "two;", "(one two)", "(two one)", and "two-fold".</li>
     * <li>You should print to the console in the usual way, not return a string.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * Also note the leading space after the line number and colon:
     * <pre>
     * (number):  (line contents)
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Your solution must match the expected output exactly, otherwise you will not receive
     * credit.
     * <p>
     * Complete the Javadoc comment for this function and write it.
